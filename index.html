<p>Space Warps is a Zooniverse project, to be launched in Spring 2013,
that will crowd-source the discovery of gravitational lenses.  While the
Zooniverse dev team are building the main site, identification
interface, and discussion and exploration system, the science team are
thinking about two things. The first is how to help our volunteers learn 
about gravitational lenses - what they look like, and how they work - as
quickly as possible. The second is how to analyze the identifications
made by the volunteers in order to make a ranked list of lens
candidates.</p>

<p> One way we can talk to people about how lenses work is through our
<b><a href="http://blog.spacewarps.org">project blog</a></b>. We also
give updates on the project there. These pages here are mostly quiet,
except for the sounds of scientists, tinkering.</p>

<h3>Analysis Pipeline</h3>

<p>We don't have a specific webpage about this yet - the analysis code is
still under construction.  You can <b><a
href="https://github.com/drphilmarshall/SpaceWarps">follow along on
github though.</a></b></p>

<h3>Prototype Training Webpages</h3>

<p>We want to show people what lenses look like - and what they don't!
The Spotter's Guide will be an  interactive gallery of both known lenses
and some common sources of confusion, that are  relevant to the current
survey's data.
<a href="training/SpottersGuide/index.html">Do you know what you're looking for?</a></p>

<p>We have built a little lens simulator, called "LensToy," to show
people very quickly what gravitational lenses do - you place a source
"behind" a massive galaxy in the image shown to you, and LensToy shows
you what the  corresponding lensed features would look like. 
<a href="training/Playground/index.html">Go on, have a play!</a></p>

<!-- School is not yet operational...

<p>We'd like people to understand a bit about how space warps work. If
we had a School page, we could try and explain the physics of gravitational
lensing.' </p>
